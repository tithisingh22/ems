								<p> As the field of robotics grows ever more sophisticated, a greater number of technicians are required to lend their talents to design, program, and maintain robots and robotic systems. Not surprisingly, the complexity of these
									machines
									and systems has spawned five specialized areas within the field of robotics: <br><br> </p>

								<h6>1.OPERATOR INTERFACE:</h6>
								<p>A robot is only as good as its ability to effectively communicate with a human controller. The operator interface – commonly referred to as a Human Robot Interface – is the medium that allows the user and the robot to communicate.
									Most
									specifically, it is the method by which a human operator can give pre-programmed commands for the robot to execute.</p>

								<h6>2.MOBILITY OR LOCOMOTION:</h6>
								<p>Mobility in robotics is achieved in many different ways. For example, some robots mimic human movement, like those used on assembly lines or those whose design is based on human anatomy. Flying robots and drones make use of
									propellers
									and other propulsion systems. Other robots, such as the rovers deployed on Mars and other celestial bodies, require wheels to get around.</p>

								<h6>3.MANIPULATORS & EFFECTORS:</h6>
								<p>
									For any robot to be worthwhile, it must be able to interact with its environment; that’s where manipulators and effectors come into play. These are the parts of the robot that allow it to pick up objects and move them, or manipulate
									items
									that are separate from the system. Human-like robots will employ appendages and digits that work like human hands, in order to complete a given task. In industrial settings, manipulators and effectors are perhaps more commonly
									represented
									by pincers, claws, or pushers which are all uniquely suited to move heavy pieces of equipment or materials.

								</p>


								<h6>4.PROGRAMMING:</h6>
								<p>
									Programming is essentially the language an operator uses to communicate with the robot. Traditionally, any action that a robot was required to perform had to be programmed. These days, advanced programming allows robotic systems to
									learn
									and adapt to changes within its environment, which is truly a remarkable feat of engineering.

								</p>
								<h6>5.SENSING & PERCEPTION:</h6>
								<p>
									Robots use sensors to gather information. This information lets the robot know the physical space it occupies, where it needs to go, and if any obstacles block its path. Sensors also collect information to help the robot decide how
									to
									react to objects it encounters. The right sensor must be selected for each robot’s specific application to ensure that the correct decisions are made.

									1. Numerous opportunities available <br>
									2. It is a multidisciplinary field <br>
									3. It is an extremely creative and interesting field <br>
									4. You will have plenty of room for innovation <br>

									<br>
									<em>ROBOTICS CAREER AND ITS SPECIALIZATIONS: </em><br>
									The Robotics career consists of creating robots to carry out specific activities, and these will vary with the type of robot itself. <br>
									<strong>Home automation</strong>-Capable of automating a home or building of any kind.This contributes to the main energy management, security, wellness, and communication services. <br>
									<strong>Military</strong>-Specialized in the creation of autonomous or mobile remote control robots designed for military applications. <br>
									<strong>Industrial & MedTech</strong>-This branch helps us with the study, design, and use of robots for the execution of industrial & medical processes. <br>
									<strong> Nanotechnology</strong>-This branch focuses on the manufacture of miniature devices that solve problems of maximum precision.

								<h6>THE FUTURE OF ROBOTICS</h6>
								<em> Will robots take over the world?</em>
								<p>
									Robots are already all around us, whether it’s the automated machines that assemble our vehicles or the virtual assistants that use conversational interfaces to help us around the house. Yet as we’ve seen, they’re not currently
									suitable
									for all areas of life. where machines replace humans as the dominant intelligence on the planet, such a scenario seems unlikely. <br>
									However, business network PwC predicts that up to 30% of jobs could be automated by robots by the mid-2030s .According to a report from McKinsey, automation and machines will see a shift in the way we work. They predict that across
									Europe, workers may need different skills to find work. Their model shows that activities that require mainly physical and manual skills will decline by 18% by 2030, while those requiring basic cognitive skills will decline by 28%.
									We may
									also see robots as a more integral part of our daily routine. In our homes, many simple tasks such as cooking and cleaning may be totally automated. <br> Similarly, with robots that can use computer vision and natural language
									processing, we
									may see machines that can interact with the world more, such as self-driving cars and digital assistants. Robotics may also shape the future of medicine. Surgical robots can perform extremely precise operations, and with advances in
									AI,
									could eventually carry out surgeries independently. ultimately, robots have the potential to enhance our lives.6

									Inspire the development of “a new generation of robots that are multifunctional, power-efficient, compliant, and autonomous in ways to biological organisms,” we must challenge our traditional ways of thinking about sensing,
									actuation, and control and seek new material-based concepts. <br>
									The development of multimaterial three-dimensional (3D) printing technologies further accelerates the adoption of new materials in robotics, allowing digital fabrication of heterogeneous structures with tailored mechanical,
									electrical, and optical properties. New developments in bioprinting and material transfer processes also allow the integration of biological materials and biodegradable substrates. All of these advances offer new dimensions and
									design opportunities for robotic devices that go beyond the traditional mechatronic approaches involving gears and motors. <br><br>

								<h5>ABOUT COMPONENTS</h5>
								One of the most important components of the robotic build is the actuator. An actuator is a device that converts energy into physical motion, and the vast majority of actuators produce rotary or linear motion. Linear actuators are
								defined by force, rotary actuators are defined by torque.
								There are many types of actuators, but the three most common types of actuators are hydraulic, pneumatic, and electric. <br>
								<br>
								<h6>HYDRAULIC ACTUATORS</h6>
								The Hydraulic Actuators Are Used In Robotics Handling Heavy Loads.These Actuators Can Produse Very High Force .If We Compared Them With Other Actuators.These Actuators Are Deployed Where High Speed ,Accuracy,And Stability Are
								Required. <br>
								<br>
								<h6>PNEUMATIC ACTUATORS:</h6>
								Pneumatic Actuators Are Mainly Used For System Which Require Quick And Accurate Response. <br>
								<br>
								<h6>ELECTRIC ACTUATORS:</h6>
								The Most Commonly Used Linear Actuators In Robotics .They Convert Electric Energy Into Linear Motion .There Are Ac And Dc Actuators.However Most Robotic Applicants Utilize Dc Linear Actuators. New materials and fabrication schemes
								promise a new generation of robots that are power-efficient, multifunctional, compliant, and autonomous in ways that are similar to biological organisms. <br>

									Humans are embodied and situated in the social world. Having a body and existing within a shared environment is advantageous for both the robot as well as for those people who interact with it. Autonomous robot, unlike industrial
									robots have working under fixed environment in small range while sociable robot has to work flexible in any environment with a broader perspective to do. Now sociable robot has to work with high resolution vision with camera with
									view of narrow field, and on a wide field of view has peripheral vision gives robot a binocular. <br>Building social skills into social robots makes not only a natural means of human machine communication but also a mechanism for
									boot strapping more complex behaviour.
									Major focus must be on behavioural four social interaction aspects- <br> <br>
									• An emotional model for work upon social dynamics <br>
									• Shared attention as a means for identifying saliency <br>
									• Getting feedback through verbal prosody <br>
									• Acquiring knowledge through imitation. <br> <br>
									A course in robotics trains and educates a student in the field of artificial intelligence, computer-aided manufacturing, computer integrated manufacturing system, computational geometry, robot motion planning, digital electronics
									and micro processing.
									Robotics is an essential component in many modern manufacturing industries. As the industries increases, scope for robotics also increases.
									Robots are mainly used for carrying materials including heavy parts to and from inconvenient locations and handling hazardous materials like nuclear waste.

								<h5>CAREER OPPORTUNITIES:</h5> <br>
								One can expect jobs at manufacturing industries, NASA, private industries, automobiles, appliance and industrial tools. Students who study robotics technologies at a college or technical school are prepared for careers in robot
								technology, computer-controlled machine programming, robotic sales and more. Candidates may pursue higher degrees in MS, ME, MTech in Robotics and Ph.D. in foreign universities

									Robots have an increasing presence in healthcare, such as surgical robots like Da Vinci or support robots used to deliver medical supplies around a hospital when needed. In addition, robots are also performing more routine tasks
									such as acting as guides, helping patients and visitors navigate large hospital estates, and freeing up valuable capacity for trained professionals <br>
									The Phoenix exoskeleton has enabled people paralysed from the waist down to walk again. With the cost and weight of these systems reducing, we are likely to see exoskeletons increasingly used to both enable mobility and support
									work-based activities. <br>
									Rethink Robotics have introduced the Baxter robot that is designed to work on a production line alongside humans. Human operators can re-program Baxter by moving its arms into desired configurations, much like teaching a child.
									Using such robots can reduce equipment costs for factories by allowing human-robot collaboration and minimising the changes needed to acquire and install the robot, as well as the costs associated with learning to operate and
									re-configure it.

									Robotics has evolved to become a ubiquitous part of our daily lives. The field is also expanding into new areas of application to perform ever more complex tasks that are not possible for humans or at scales that humans cannot
									reach. The rapid advance of robotic systems in recent years is largely attributed to increases in computing performance. In contrast, there has been little change in the way robots are assembled or in the choice of materials, that
									are used to drive current robotic systems. <br>The traditional concept of motor-driven robots based on mechanical transmission and computer control is deeply etched into current hardware design of robotic systems.
									Indeed, in the last decade, we have already seen encouraging advances in smart materials and new fabrication schemes for robotics.<br> In parallel, the development of multi-material three-dimensional printing technologies further
									accelerates the adoption of new materials in robotics, allowing digital fabrication of heterogeneous structures with tailored mechanical, electrical, and optical properties. All of these advances offer new dimensions and design
									opportunities for robotic devices that go beyond the traditional mechatronic approaches involving gears and motors. <br>
									As our expectations of robots rise daily, it is increasingly necessary to use specialized machines that are built from the best and most advanced materials available for each task. In order to find the best materials for the next
									generation of robots, it is crucial that we examine and continue the research.

									The development of flexible and stretchable sensors for e-skin applications has seen an unprecedented growth in recent years. <br>This has to be attributed to development of novel material and engineering which has enabled
									innovative devices. Flexible and stretchable e-skin would have significant impact on the tactile sensing capability of humanoids, therefore will have a critical component of future humanoids.
									Despite several reported progress in development of flexible pressure and strain sensors for e-skin application, there are still several significant hurdles that need to be addressed to enable mass production. <br>This includes
									low-cost fabrication process with higher device yield with similar characteristics. Other factors such as lower power consumption, device sensitivity, device stability after repeated operation, response time and operation bandwidth
									are also critical factors. More importantly, device integration with system is crucial for the true success of e-skin for tactile sensing of humanoids. This would require development of an electronic interface consisting components
									for digitalisation of signal, signal conditioning, data processing and transmission of data. Furthermore, the performance of robotic system equipped with e-skin will also heavily be governed by the software algorithms processing and
									learning methods to distinguish between different tactile data.<br> In addition to tactile sensing, other features like self-healing, chemical and biological sensing can also benefit e-skin. Recent developments have led to e-skin
									sensors exceeding sensitivity of human skins in terms of detection of human skin. Although there are many issues yet to be addressed, the progress in the development trend in e-skin suggest that humanoid equipped with flexible and
									stretchable will be possible in near future.
